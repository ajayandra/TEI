On this auspicious day, Ābhīrī, wife of the son of Paramābhimāni, whose good qualities are well known, after worshipping Brahmins with plenty of gifts established [this liṅga of] Śiva together with two measrues of [land-] donations with the permission of her son to increase the merit of [her] husband, who has departed from this [world] to [reach] godhood. And to this Śiva, worshipped in the shrine, she gave [this] permanent endowment [consisting of] things such as vapra (cultivated land?), garments and ornaments, [and she also gave] the name Anuparameśvara [to the liṅga].

Ābhīrīgomiṇī, the life to her husband who is like a deity to her,  gave two plots of land on the raised river bank in Svayapupa(?) in Vempā village, to this Lord Devadeva (i.e. Śiva) for the purpose of providing for smearing and bathing [the liṅga], perfumes and incensce for worshipping [the liṅga] and bali offerings and repairing anything that is broked for the [liṅga] named Anuparameśvara, which she has established herself, for the increasing of merit for her husband, now in heaven, and also for the attainment of wealth, freedom from disease, long life and immortality for her honourable offspring, including Bhaumagupta.
