# TEI - Text Encoding Initiative

## Using Manuscripts, Inscriptions as an object for research
### How to make pages into usable/re-usable research materials?
- Digitization
- Conversion to text
- Encoding text
- Providing text and images together
### Digitization
- Images of Manuscript
- TIF or PNG (for high resolution image quality)
- Conversion to text (Getting Text)
- Is it handwritten?
  -- Transcribe (use tools like [From the Page] (https://fromthepage.com/), [Transkribus] (https://readcoop.eu/transkribus/))

  -- OCR for Typescripts
      --- Online Systems
      --- Phone Apps

          ---- ABBYY
          ---- Omnipage
      --- OCR for Handwritten (Handwritten Text Recognition)

          ---- [Online OCR] (www.onlineocr.net)
          ---- [Transkribus NN] (www.transkribus.eu/Transkribus)
      --- Text Processor

- Wny text and page Image together?
  -- Presenting the original image together with the transcript is a more robust research method.
  -- allows to verify the transcript, and perhaps improve it 
  -- may reveal other aspects to the document you didn't notice
  -- make the document available for future research
## TEI (Text Encoding Initiative)
- TEI is a standard set of XML
- XML is a longstanding and widely used technology
- XML marks up the structure of a document and not the appearance (unlike HTML)
- XML provides a way to validate documents against a defined schema
- [TEI Doc] (https://tei-c.org/release/doc/tei-p5-doc/en/html/SG.html)
